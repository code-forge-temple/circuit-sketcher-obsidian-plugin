## Usage

1. Copy the contents of the `./dist` folder (it contains the `circuit-sketcher` folder) into `<your Obsidian vault location>/.obsidian/plugins/`.
2. Open Obsidian and go to `Settings` â‡’ `Community Plugins`. If you do not see `Circuit Sketcher`, press the `Installed plugins` refresh button, then activate the plugin.
3. Use the ribbon icon or command palette to create a new circuit sketcher file.
4. Start drawing your circuit on the canvas:
    - On the canvas, right-click to show the canvas menu, and select `Create Node`.
    - Right-click on the node to show the node menu, and select `Change Image` and select an image relevant to your circuit node.
    - Right-click on the node to show the node menu, and select `Add Port` and select the port location and type.
    - You can rename the circuit node label or port label by double-clicking on the label. The port or port label can also be deleted (right-click on the port to show the port menu and go from there).
    - After you are satisfied with your changes to the circuit node, and if you wish to save the circuit node to be able to reuse it in the current or a different `.circuit-sketcher` file, you can right-click on the circuit node and press `Save Node to Library` (this will update the root Obsidian vault `circuit-sketcher.lib` file).
    - You can reuse the node by right-clicking on the canvas and selecting `Add Node from Library`.
    - The connections between circuit nodes can be done by drag-and-dropping one port to the destination port (if it is a compatible port).
